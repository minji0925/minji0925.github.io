        <h2>Thoughts, New Reads, and Life Updates from April</h2>
    
        <p><i>Last Edited: May 3, 2025</i></p>

        <p>April = exam season + endless grinding, but I managed to consistently distract myself from studying, so now I have a fair amount of things to write about. 
            <br>Welcome to the unabridged version! The last four sections are the ones that have been cut out from the public post, the first two because they’re not very well-developed and the other two because they are too uncensored and feel like journal entries.

        <h3 id="fiction">What Do You Look For in Fiction?</h3>
        <p>
            - Rules of Civility by Amor Towles was the last book on my list of 19th/20th century upper class people books, and it was honestly quite impressive. It’s the story of Katey Kontent, a young working class girl who, with her friend Eve, meets the rich banker Tinker Grey and gets introduced to the elite society of New York. The opening scene of the book was the literary version of Begin Again, the movie starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. Rules of Civility has solidified my definition of ‘good’ historical and contemporary fiction. When asked the question “what do you look for in fiction”, my standard answer used to skirt around good plot, character, or writing, but these are just listing core elements, without any specificity. Now, my definition of good fiction is whatever that feels magical. Magical is perhaps an unfitting description for stories that are supposedly realistic, but it has more to do with the author’s magic. It’s the kind of thing that makes me want to binge read the book in a day or two, that draws me to the characters and plot. In that sense, I think that there isn’t a universal standard for good writing - it’s whatever draws the readers to the story. And in that sense, Rules of Civility felt like a dive into an interesting person’s life, perhaps a shallow escape from reality, but I’d like to think that I got more out of it than just that. </p><br>
    
        <h3 id="shadowofthewind">Read The Shadow of the Wind</h3>
        <p>
            - I reread The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, and read the sequel, The Angel’s Game. The first time I read The Shadow of the Wind was during a school trip to Busan, and funnily enough, all I remember from the trip is being glued to the book the entire time. In my defense, we spent hours in the bus (the whole grade was divided into four groups so the routing was done inefficiently), and the sightseeing wasn’t very impressive. But back to the point, that’s how good the book was. I had no idea that Spanish authors were such talented storytellers (I’ve never read Spanish literature before, not even Don Quixote), and the writing quality was flawless. A lot can get lost in translation, from what I’ve seen in Korean (Bora Chung) and Japanese (Haruki Murakami), but my guess is that Spanish and English are similar enough for unnoticeable losses. A review on Goodreads mentioned that American authors gravitate towards ‘unrealistic happy endings’ while European authors prefer ‘poignant sad ones’. The neverending tragedies of the book reminded me a bit of 20th century Korean literature, and I’m starting to see the appeal of diversifying my selection of books from different countries. There were other aspects of the book that felt different; the magical realism felt distinctly Spanish and very enjoyable, so I’ve now decided to read one of the original magical realism works: Fictions by Jorge Luis Borges. 
            <br><br>- The second book, The Angel’s Game, had very similar vibes to season 1 of the Netflix show You. Joe Goldberg in the show works at a bookstore, has exquisite taste in books, and knows so much about old books. But you can tell that something’s off from the very beginning, and you eventually figure out why. Guinevere Beck and Cristina are quite similar as well, now that I think more. 
            </p><br>
        

        <h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>
        <p>
            - What new things have I been listening to this month? I usually open Spotify to play the perfect kind of music for whatever mood I’m in, but pinpointing which genre and artist becomes a challenge. So I usually resort to the Spotify daylist, but I am not a huge fan of the daylist system itself. Apparently daylist constructions are based on pre-existing Spotify algorithms that analyze music taste on a hyper specific level (the titles of these daylists make this very clear) and tailor recommendations based on the time of the day. Honestly, while the hyper-specificty of the daylists delighted me at first, the daylists seem to have gone worse than before. Why does a jpop daylist include Blackpink and IVE? And vice versa? It also seems to reinforce current trends in listening. My daylist was stuck in the chinese rnb and cpop loop for a whole week during my peak Chinese music listening phase. Working at Spotify would actually be very fulfilling, knowing that I get to shape the music taste of millions (billions?) of people around the world; it’s a position of great power.
<br><br>- Going off on a tangent, I am starting to wonder how people of the past discovered new music. This applies to everything else as well, but music is particularly interesting because of how much ‘music discovery’ is driven by streaming services. Sure, I would ask people for book recommendations every once in a while, but asking for song recommendations happens much less frequently. Maybe this has to do with how long you usually sit with one book vs one song, since I switch from one song to another much more often than books. So back to the point, Spotify is my ultimate go-to place foir new music, but what about during the pre-Spotify era? The radio, MTV, concerts, word of mouth, what else? Mostly mass media (too homogenous) and word of mouth (which has its limitations). But does this mean that practically no one had niche taste in music? 
<br><br>- Another tangent, but shazam is a great way to discover new music! Whenever I am in the mall, a cool store, or cafe with good music, shazam will tell me what song they’re playing right now - pretty good for finding new music.

        </p><br>
    
        <h3 id="exams">Exams and Education</h3>
        <p>
            - I had eight midterm exams, five of which were ranked (I care less about the other three, getting an A is much easier than being in the 96th percentile). It may actually be over for me for calculus and English (90th percentile in English means that things are going very badly), so I have to do well in finals, and may have to do very well on the college admissions exam (Suneung). 
<br><br>- But this doesn’t necessarily mean I have to blame myself and suffer during the process, at least I hope that this will not be the case. I prefer to think about exams as a pretty bad indicator of true smartness, especially when the thing you care about is ranks, not scores. An analogy I use to describe my school environment to other people is a spinoff of the prisoner’s dilemma. Each student can either cooperate or defect, where cooperating is the happy 9-5 studying, and defecting comprises studying past midnight, going to private tuition (hagwons), and learning calculus in sixth grade. In a perfect educational system, everyone would cooperate - be happy and smart. But because exams are ranked and the parents are overenthusiastic about sending their kids to medical school and other top colleges, people start defecting, one by one. The toxic culture of studying past midnight and hiring a bunch of tutors to ace in exams becomes more widespread, and people who kindly decide to cooperate (like me, who gets enough sleep and doesn’t waste money in private tuition) are practically non-existent. Of course, not all schools are like this - this happens if (1) there are enough players, or people willing to study, in the game, and (2) they have the drive and parent’s support (money for private tuition) to defect. The analogy I’ve built for myself is quite fitting, but I’m still not sure whether all of this is me giving excuses for not being the top top student, or it serves as a solid bird’s eye view of the situation.

        <h3 id="running">Running</h3>
        <p>
- I have been going on 7km (I try to keep it at 7, but give up at 5 when I’m too tired from school) runs every two days! I don’t think I’ve ever run this much, and this seems to be a good indicator of my mental state. Maybe the senior year stress is good for me, because I’m pushing myself harder during runs; I’m increasing distance rapidly to compensate for my increasing stress level. 
            <br><br>- I went to a mall today, at the time of writing, and I looked around the Decathlon and Hoka stores. The amount of running gear offered by Decathlon was a delightful surprise - I have zero running gear other than running sunglasses. Would highly recommend people to check out sporting gear, especially for running! The Hoka store had a 3D foot scanner, which was very very cool as well.
                    </p><br>

        <h3 id="funthings">Things Worth Trying Out</h3>
        <p>
- I love Sudoku! I somehow come back to the hobby every year, after months-long hiatus periods. The good thing is, I notice myself having improved over the course of the hiatus period. A fresh perspective helps, I guess. 
            <br><br>- I used to dabble in pen palling years ago, and have recently realized how cheap it is. I’m not sure what the rate is like in other countries, but it costs less than a dollar (roughly 50 cents usd?) to send a postcard or a letter to a different country. A piece of paper is practically weightless, but even then, the distance it travels and the amount of infrastructure it goes through suggest that a higher price may make more sense. So I don’t know, considering how cheap and convenient (if the post office is close by), getting back into writing letters could be useful for spending less time on the screen.
                    </p><br>

        <h3 id="riskaverse">On Being Risk Averse</h3>
        <p>
           - I’ve recently come to realize that I am incredibly risk-averse when it comes to people things. I usually take risks when I see the value, but never this. There are multiple ways of explaining this, and I’m not sure how good I will be at peeling the layers, but I’ll try. 
           <br><br>- Layer 1: The general consensus on friendships, or just about any type of relationship, is that every relationship is different, every friend is different. And I agree! One thing that has been bothering me, though, is that it’s very hard to push myself and the other person out of our comfort zone, the ‘unique’ common ground we’ve settled on. Examples might help. I visit my grandmother almost every weekend, and we talk about a lot of things, from politics to novels to my everyday school life. I know all the elementary facts about her, but for some reason, we’ve never talked about her career or her life before retirement, or just random things I’d like to get her perspective on. Or take my father as another example. All our breakfast conversations converge to the college admissions talk, in addition to trash-talking Korea (the conversation is mostly led by him, so I usually just sit there and nod along). Which is all the more uncanny, considering that we both enjoy reading, and my dad majored in electrical engineering (which is something I’m also interested in). My disinclination towards technical talk with my father makes more sense in this context, because of bad memories from the past when he quizzed me on book stuff, but even then this relationship seems too unhealthy. Extending this to friends, I talk about nothing but college admissions with a handful of school friends, and because of how limited the scope of the conversation is, changing the topic makes things awkward. It’s almost as if there’s an invisible wall that keeps us friendly acquaintances, rather than actual close friends. 
           <br><br>- Layer 2: Adding on to this layer, I guess the biggest risk aversion is changing specific friendship dynamics. Even if there’s a friend I would prefer to talk to less frequently, I wouldn’t really do anything about it. Coming off as rude or offensive is the risk I would rather not take. This is not perfectly healthy, but it’s still fine. But the consequences are slightly worse for the opposite situation. Even when there’s someone I think I like, maybe more than as a friend, I would rather not risk the friendship that’s already there, so I end up not doing anything. So far, this has been good for me because I know I wouldn’t date anyone before turning 18. But even now, when 18 is inching closer, I realize that I won't be changing my attitude any time soon (to be fair it’s quite hard to change), and this can be bad for me in the long term.
</p><br>

        <h3 id="signs">Signs</h3>
        <p>
            - Signs from people are hard to read. Me being very low-energy during a conversation doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m disinterested! It may be due to my school induced exhaustion, or just anything else, really. The more I realize the challenges of ‘reading signs’, I wonder how hard reading my signs are, or if anything gets misread. How do I know if the other person is enjoying the conversation? Initially, a lot of this felt like overthinking, but it does seem like an important question because of the consequences.</p><br>
